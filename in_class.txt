Programming Assignment:
Download and run the simple python implementation of RSA from:
https://gist.github.com/JonCooperWorks/5314103#filersa-py
and answer the following questions:
a) Run the program and enter as prime numbers 17 and 19. What is the public key and the private key?
Your public key is  (73, 323)  and your private key is  (217, 323)

b) Give a brief explanation (less than a paragraph) of the following functions from the python code:
-gcd(a, b) (line 14) greatest common denominator
-multiplicative_inverse(e, phi) (line 22) 8 -> 1/8
-is_prime(num) (line 49) x<2 || x%2 || sqrt(x/2) fast-ish prime finding

c) Explain differences and similarities between the RSA algorithm discussed in pages 685-686 and the
implementation found in the code: generate_keypair (line 59), encrypt(line 86), decrypt(line 94)
No CA
encryption is done character-wise instead of block-wise
